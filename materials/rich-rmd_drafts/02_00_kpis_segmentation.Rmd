- Some of the KPIs we care about at **intendo**
- Writing a package function that gets us a KPI from a DB table
- Using segmentation: it's really just filtering data
- Writing a segmentation function that works with our data
- Writing a KPI function or two that uses segments
- Testing out the functions to make sure they work well
- Design review. What could be better? Is it intuitive and explainable?
