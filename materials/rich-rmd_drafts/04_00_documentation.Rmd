## Documentation Pieces that Will Make the Package a Smashing Success

Outline of Module

- How much documentation is needed and what formats are available?
- The README is the selling point of your package (even in an organization!)
- The **pkgdown** site is still insanely useful for proprietary packages
- Internal documentation should be seriously buffed
- Super simple examples as documentation: `tldr`
- Training material (if available) should be posted somewhere
- The data dictionary: so useful, yet, we don't see it often enough
- Documentation in organization-specific places
