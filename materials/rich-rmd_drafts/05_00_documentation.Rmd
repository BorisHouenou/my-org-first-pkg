## Documentation Pieces that will make the package a success

Outline of Module

- How much documentation is needed?
- What kinds of documentation?
- A data dictionary: a thing that is so useful, yet, we don't see often enough
- Documentation in organization-specific places (e.g., Confluence, Tettra, internal webpages)
- Super simple examples as documentation: `tldr`
- The README is the selling point of your package (even in an organization!)
