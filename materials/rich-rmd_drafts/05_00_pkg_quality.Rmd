## Ensuring We Have Quality in Mind When It Comes to the Internal Package

Learning objectives

- Determining the quality metrics for package (what does success look like?)
- Building a test suite and determining code coverage
- Using data extracts for testing purposes
- Getting user feedback and implementing fixes, feature requests, etc.
- Gauging user experience during tutorials and 1-to-1 training sessions
- Using an issue tracker to keep track of all package-related issues
- Manual testing scripts (for those hard-to-automate tests)
- Using code reviews and code-pairing sessions
- Checking our package with R CMD check
