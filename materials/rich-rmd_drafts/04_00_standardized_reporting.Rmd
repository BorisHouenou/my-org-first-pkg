## Building Package Functions for Standardizing Reporting

Outline of Module

- Standardization is actually advantageous in organizations
- When to use standardized plots and tables
- Writing package functions that take time-series data and create standardized plots and tables
- Just enough standardization... we can also have some variation, maybe some flair
- Using standardized plots and tables in periodic reports (and, writing a function that does that)
- Standardized plots and tables need standardized data, so, we'll make a function that creates that data (and let's learn about **cron** for sake of automating things)
