## Creating KPI-type Functions and Doing Segmentation

Outline of Module

- Planning out the functions you'll want to include
- Let's make some functions that get a few KPIs
- We need to define the KPI definitions and calculations first
- Writing package functions that get a few KPIs from a DB table
- CODE DEMO: `02_01_pkg_functions.Rmd`
    - YOU CODE (30 minutes)
        - Write functions for calculating four KPIs
- CODE DEMO: `02_02_pkg_functions.Rmd`
    - YOU CODE (30 minutes)
        - Create a function that segments the `daily_users` table
        - Augment functions created earlier to use segmentation
        - Test out the functions to make sure they work well
- Let's share and discuss what we did
