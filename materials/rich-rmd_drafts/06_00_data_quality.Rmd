- Responsibilities for ensuring the correctness of data
- Database tables, 3rd party data, and curated data need to be checked for quality
- We can develop package functions that automate data quality checks on database tables
- Development of functions that notify us if important data wasn't delivered to us
- Using dashboards to monitor data quality (powered by our package functions)
